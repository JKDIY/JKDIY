   <p>Taking on a DIY project yourself is not always that simple, but if you understand how the mind and brain work, any DIY project you take on will be a success. You don't need to have a Ph. D in neuroscience to understand the science of how the mind and brain work, just simply accept the fact that we can achieve anything if we have the right mindset. With that said, don’t ever try to be the mind of someone else’s brain. We are the mind of our own brains, so we all have the choice to either create a miserable life for ourselves or create a wonderful one. <br><br>
   Poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: A man is what he thinks about all day long.

   <h3>The brain's cerebrum</h3> 
    </div>
    
<p>Our cerebrum manages our thoughts for us. When it receives a thought, it says, "ah! so this is where you’re going with this". It then initiates the body fluids to influence the way you’re asking your body to behave. For example: Sending a negative thought to your cerebrum will trigger stress. The brain will ensure your body reacts in sync with your thought. If you think you're a failure, you'll feel like a failure and behave like a failure reinforcing your belief that you must be a failure.</p>

  <p>I read this analogy somewhere, so I apologise for not sourcing my source.</p>
<p>Imagine your mind to be a farm and your thoughts to be the seeds. You can plant either good seeds (Roses) or bad seeds (poison ivy); whatever seed you choose to focus on to plant will then grow and multiply. The same happens in your mind, whichever thought you choose to focus on will then grow and multiply.
</p>
        <ul>
 <li>You are the planter of your seeds</li>
 <li>You are the thinker of your thoughts.</li>

   <h3>How to take control back</h3>
    
        </div>
           
  
<p>If you’re having issues dealing with your life, trouble with relationships, forgetting, career development, social skills, keeping friends, etc.… then that’s because your life growing up was hard and you were around others with similar issues or worse, all contributing to negative thoughts. To be able to come out of this burden you must understand how the brain reacts to fulfill the demands of the mind. Understanding this flow of brain logic will make it easier for you as you re-educate yourself. You can follow along to communicate with your brain to help you store positive things with new relevant information. For every though your brain responds to is a thought stored in memory. If you’re repeating the same thought, your brain will enhance that connection to your memory location so it will be easier to quickly retrieve that information when you need it without confusion. Any new negative thoughts you have is a new thought of memory that is storage with a link to all its other negative connections. So the next time you think negatively, the brain searches for similar paths. Like using a GPS. A GPS will find similar routes with the quickest one to your destination. The more negative routes you create become the environment you build for the brain to use.</p>     
<p>Your destination is who you become. You become a routine to your destination. (A miserable person) Like a job, going to the same job every day you’re not happy with until you retire.</p>
<p>However, it’s not too late to change your behaviour of thought. Your brain creates new cells every day for this purpose so anything new you give it creates new memories that can multiply creating a new map of pathways of positive connections. Like getting a new job where your route is now different. The more you travel on that route to work the less you remember about the older route.</p>
<p>To become good at this we need to develop cognitive skills, this is a type of skill-set we need to learn. A process to skillfully help us to combine new information into your prior knowledge in order to create new knowledge. Our thinking, learning, remembering and paying attention, is all made possible because of cognition skills. You develop cognitive skills throughout your life. If you develop these skills it will help your brain remember things quicker, problem solving, have better attention, focus, and think logically. We all know how to process these cognitive skills to some degree or you wouldn’t be able to travel to work and you wouldn't even be able to read this text.  Your memory plays a role in all cognitive processes. It takes time to develop and create a certain mind-set skill. The first step is to believe in yourself and give yourself credit for every successful think you do. If you made it home during a winter storm with very bad driving conditions, don't thank GOD. Tell yourself DAMN! I'm a good driver.</p>
