                <p>To be good at anything you do, you have to be in control of yourself. Controlling your thoughts involves actively directing your attention and consciously choosing the focus of your mental energy. Here are some strategies to help you control your thoughts:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="advise">
                <p>Awareness: Begin by becoming aware of your thoughts. Notice when your mind starts to wander or when negative or unproductive thoughts arise.</p>
                <p>Mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, to help calm your mind and increase your awareness of the present moment. Mindfulness can help you observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them.</p>
                <p>Challenge Negative Thoughts: When negative or unhelpful thoughts arise, challenge them by asking yourself if they are rational or realistic. Replace negative thoughts with more positive or constructive ones.</p>
                <p>Focus on the Present: Avoid dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Focus on the present moment and the tasks at hand to prevent your mind from wandering into unproductive or anxiety-inducing thoughts.</p>     
                <p>Set Goals: Set clear and achievable goals for yourself. Having a sense of purpose and direction can help you maintain focus and control over your thoughts.</p>
                <p>Practice Gratitude: Cultivate a mindset of gratitude by regularly reflecting on the things you are thankful for. This can help shift your focus away from negative thoughts and towards the positive aspects of your life.</p>
                <p>Limit Exposure to Negative Influences: Be mindful of the media, people, or situations that trigger negative thoughts or emotions. Limit your exposure to these influences as much as possible.</p>
                <p>Seek Support: If you find it difficult to control your thoughts on your own, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and techniques to help you manage your thoughts more effectively.</p>
