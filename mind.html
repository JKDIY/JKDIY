   <p>To be good at anything you do you have to be in control of yourself. The same way you would control your car when you drive it, you can take control of yourself. What I’m saying is, Think of your body as the car, your brain as the engine and your mind as you, the driver. With that in mind, let's begin.
</p>

<div class="advise">
<p>Our brain is amazing, actually better than amazing. The closest we came to making one are computers and even the most sophisticated ones with all its bells and whistles are in no comparison to the brain. Here is the thing, there is only one model of the brain and the human body and we were all born with the same model and the best part of it, it cost us nothing. The catch is, it came with a built-in mind (The End User) and that is us. We are the mind of your own brain. Don’t ever try to be the mind of someone else’s brain. Your mind, which is your thoughts, sends information to your brain and your brain responds to you and only you. You the user, have the choice to either create a miserable life for yourself or create a wonderful one.</p>
<p>This identical brain we all carry around with us is made up of many different parts each having its own function and purpose. For this topic I will only focus on a part of the brain called the “cerebrum” which is connected to the spinal cord of the body. Why the cerebrum? Because it initiates and coordinates movement and regulates your body temperature. Other areas of the cerebrum enable speech, judgment, thinking and reasoning, problem-solving, emotions and learning. Other functions relate to vision, hearing, touch and other senses.</p>
   
 
    <div class="c">
   <h3>Cerebrum</h3> 
    </div>
    
<p>Our cerebrum manages our thoughts for us. When it receives a thought, it says, "ah! so this is where you’re going with this", so it initiates the body fluids to influence the way you’re asking your body to behave. For example: A negative thought triggers stress.  If you want your car to make a left turn, you will turn your steering wheel to the left, tap on the brake so your engine adjusts its speed allowing the wheels to turn. So the next time you want to be stressed out. Simply send a negative thought to your cerebrum, that part of the brain will ensure your body reacts in sync with your thought. So if you think you're a failure, you'll feel like a failure. Then you'll act like a failure, which reinforces your belief that you must be a failure.</p>

<p>If the mind is the user of the brain, then our thoughts create our reality. Poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: A man is what he thinks about all day long.

   <h3>Control your Thoughts</h3> 
    </div>

<p>The only way to change a negative thought is by changing it to a positive one. The only way to make your car change directions from a bumpy road to a smooth road is to turn the wheel. If you only think about turning the wheel and not believing you can do it, you will only imagine your destiny. When you make that turn all of sudden everything in front of you looks different and you automatically adjust to the environment.</p>
<p>You see, the mistake we make in life is when we’re unhappy we first try to change our environment to boost happiness. So we travel to escape our problems, we upgrade material things and before you know it, we’re right back to where we started and we re-book a vacation for the next year. Why? Because it was only a temporary boost.  You didn’t really get off the road, you kept your car in the same direction. It’s like having someone come out to patch the bumpy road for you for a few miles and you install air-conditioning. But you’re still heading down the same road.</p>
<p>This is how businesses make their money. Every time we become unhappy, businesses boom. This is why when you visit a travel agency to book a flight, the sales pitch is to sell you a package to make you extra happy.  Businesses make money on how we manage our thoughts. Think of it, if 90% of the population had positive thoughts that would be 90% of happiness in the world. The need to travel would not be that urgent, the need to upgrade your furniture or buy a new cell phone today this minute will not be that urgent. How will the economy boom if all people are happy. Businesses are in business to make money by creating nice things, better places, nicer homes, fancy restaurants. All to boost happiness and keep us on the same road. As the novelty wears off, we return to our old negative self so we go into a cycle to visit new fancy restaurants, out of country visits, new phones, bigger TVs etc.… you get the picture?</p>
<p>The sooner unhappy people realize that changing their environment is a temporary solution and does not address the root cause of suffering, they will start to focus more on the question, “why am I unhappy” The only way to fix the root cause is by changing the attention of your thoughts. You must become the thinker and the solution maker of your thoughts.</p>

  <p>I read this analogy somewhere, so I apologise for not sourcing my source.</p>
<p>Imagine your mind to be a farm and your thoughts to be the seeds. You can plant either good seeds (Roses) or bad seeds (poison ivy); whatever seed you choose to focus on to plant will then grow and multiply. The same happens in your mind, whichever thought you choose to focus on will then grow and multiply.
</p>
        <ul>
 <li>You are the planter of your seeds</li>
 <li>You are the thinker of your thoughts.</li>
 
</ul>

   <h3>How to take control back</h3>
    
        </div>
           
  
<p>If you’re having issues dealing with your life, trouble with relationships, forgetting, career development, social skills, keeping friends, etc.… then that’s because your life growing up was hard and you were around others with similar issues or worse, all contributing to negative thoughts. To be able to come out of this burden you must understand how the brain reacts to fulfill the demands of the mind. Understanding this flow of brain logic will make it easier for you as you re-educate yourself. You can follow along to communicate with your brain to help you store positive things with new relevant information. For every though your brain responds to is a thought stored in memory. If you’re repeating the same thought, your brain will enhance that connection to your memory location so it will be easier to quickly retrieve that information when you need it without confusion. Any new negative thoughts you have is a new thought of memory that is storage with a link to all its other negative connections. So the next time you think negatively, the brain searches for similar paths. Like using a GPS. A GPS will find similar routes with the quickest one to your destination. The more negative routes you create become the environment you build for the brain to use.</p>     
<p>Your destination is who you become. You become a routine to your destination. (A miserable person) Like a job, going to the same job every day you’re not happy with until you retire.</p>
<p>However, it’s not too late to change your behaviour of thought. Your brain creates new cells every day for this purpose so anything new you give it creates new memories that can multiply creating a new map of pathways of positive connections. Like getting a new job where your route is now different. The more you travel on that route to work the less you remember about the older route.</p>
<p>To become good at this we need to develop cognitive skills, this is a type of skill-set we need to learn. A process to skillfully help us to combine new information into your prior knowledge in order to create new knowledge. Our thinking, learning, remembering and paying attention, is all made possible because of cognition skills. You develop cognitive skills throughout your life. If you develop these skills it will help your brain remember things quicker, problem solving, have better attention, focus, and think logically. We all know how to process these cognitive skills to some degree or you wouldn’t be able to travel to work and you wouldn't even be able to read this text.  Your memory plays a role in all cognitive processes. It takes time to develop and create a certain mind-set skill. The first step is to believe in yourself and give yourself credit for every successful think you do. If you made it home during a winter storm with very bad driving conditions, don't thank GOD. Tell yourself DAMN! I'm a good driver.</p>
<p>My next upcoming section will include “Brain and Memory” The Cognitive process and how memory is stored. How the neural pathways are activated. The trillions of synaptic connections form one giant network in the brain that is responsible for everything we think about, feel and why we remember. </p>
