            <p>Your Mind and Brain.</p>

                <p>To be good at anything you do, you have to be in control of yourself. Just as you control your car when you drive, you can take control of yourself. Think of your body as the car, your brain as the engine, and your mind as the driver. With that in mind, let's begin.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="advise">
                <p>Our brain is amazing, better than any computer. There's only one model of the brain and the human body, and we were all born with the same model. It came with a built-in mind (The End User), which is us. We are the mind of our own brain. Your mind (thoughts) sends information to your brain, and your brain responds to you and only you. You have the choice to create a miserable or wonderful life for yourself.</p>
                <p>The cerebrum, a part of the brain, manages our thoughts. It initiates and coordinates movement, regulates body temperature, enables speech, judgment, thinking, emotions, and learning. It's like sending commands to your car to turn or stop. Negative thoughts trigger stress; your brain reacts accordingly. Change negative thoughts to positive ones to change your reality.</p>

                <p>If the mind is the user of the brain, then our thoughts create our reality. Poet Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: "A man is what he thinks about all day long."</p>

                    <h3>Control your Thoughts</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Change negative thoughts to positive ones. Just like turning a steering wheel to change direction, focus your thoughts positively. Changing your environment temporarily boosts happiness. Businesses profit from our pursuit of happiness. Changing your thoughts addresses the root cause of suffering. Become the thinker and solution maker of your thoughts.</p>

        <div class="mainsec">
            <div class="left">
                <p>Imagine your mind as a farm and thoughts as seeds. Plant good seeds (positive thoughts) or bad seeds (negative thoughts). The seed you focus on grows. You are the planter and thinker of your thoughts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You plant the seeds.</li>
                    <li>You think the thoughts.</li>

                    <h3>How to take control back</h3>
                </div>
                <p>If you struggle with life's challenges, understand how the brain fulfills mind's demands. Focus on changing thought patterns. Develop cognitive skills to combine new information into your knowledge. Your thinking, learning, and attention depend on cognitive skills. Believe in yourself and credit your successes.</p>
