<p>You want to have the right attitude when tackling a DIY project. A poor attitude will bring frustration and mistakes. Your mind depends on how well you communicate with your body. Why? Because The more negative your mind is, the less focused you are, which leads to poor decisions. The more focused your mind is the better your understanding, which leads to better decisions. When you have a positive attitude and you’re in a happy mood, everything around you will be easy to manage. </p>
         
<p>You have to pay attention to how you do things. For example: let’s say there are a bunch of people around you that just wouldn't leave you and it’s frustrating you, So I tell you, if you poop they will go away. So you get up, go to the bathroom and poop. You come back and they are still there. So you tell me, I did that, it didn’t work. The story to this is how you did it. If you had pooped in front of them, they would have left. The pooping technique does work, it's how you did it that didn’t work. You were not focused enough to see that, because your mind was full of other thoughts in it.

   <h3>The Power of Self-Love</h3> 
    </div>
    
    <p> Our mind makes us hesitant towards change. Think of yourself flying a kite. You are standing on the ground and the kite is up in the air. Now picture your mind( with all your thoughts) up there as your kite. </p>
    <p> You should have a vision of something like this. <img src="images/kite.png" alt="brain" style="width:150px;height:130px;margin-left:15px;"> Now suppose you need to fix the tail on your kite. To do that you will need to reel it in so you can touch it and fix it. but it will take a few minutes of reeling it into your body before your hands can fix it. </p>

<p>This works the same way as your mind, all of your thoughts are up there. (A wandering mind separated from our body) If you need to work on your thoughts you will need to bring them back to your body so your brain can fix them. but since you’re not connected by a string to your mind, the only way to get your mind back to your body so your brain can fix them is to use a breathing technique called 4-7-8 (No thinking/No talking).  Where you breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and out for 8. With every in-breath you make, you only listen to your breath and nothing else, this will bring your mind closer to your body, and for every out-breath you make you clear out the toxins in your mind. </p>

<p> When you feel you’re ready to open your eyes, open them and everything you touch you should be aware you’re touching it. You should be able to feel your finger touching anything you touch. Everything you look at, you should be able to notice the colors, as you look around, pay attention to what is around you. ( Tell yourself – this is where I am right now ) you’ve just brought your mind back to your body in the now moment and your mind is now clear.</p>


<p>The theory of “mindset” was born in the 1970s by the psychologist Carol Dweck. She says Mindset is about taking responsibility for your actions. It’s about seeing how much you can improve, and then actively working towards that improvement. Ok! So how do you do that? This may not seem very important to some, but self-love is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Why is that? It paves the way to a positive attitude. Right now your mindset without you even knowing it maybe "That's just who I am. I can't change it." so let’s change that mindset and shift it and transform it to – "I know I can do this. It can't be that difficult." You’ve just begun the journey to self-love. Meaning the process of creating a positive loop inside your brain.</p>
 
   
    
<p> The reason for that is to have you understand that it is only you who can fix your problems and what happens in your head if you don’t. The first thing is to acknowledge “ I NEED HELP” and send that message to the neurotransmitters to let the brain know that you will be taking some steps to fix yourself.</p>

        <h3>Self-Love means having a high regard for your own well-being and happiness.</h3>
           </div>
    
    <p>Hug yourself, do it now. Give yourself a big hug.</p>
<p>Say in your mind or out loud.
I love you so much. ( Do this first thing in the morning and last thing at night and when you need to throughout the day.)<br>
Now say these words. Look at yourself in a mirror if you can. As you say them smile as if you’re speaking to someone wonderful. Because you are.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>You are a brilliant person.</li>
        <li>You’re looking great today.</li>
        <li>Look at you, you’re so full of potential.</li>
        <li>You are worth the very best life has to offer.</li>
        <li>You are amazing.</li>
        <li>Do you know how amazing you are?</li>
        <li>Look at the kindness in your eyes, in your smile.</li>
        <li>You are so lovable.</li>
        <li>You can do anything be anyone you wish.</li>
        <li>Believe in yourself.</li>
        <li>I love you, I love you, I love you.</li>
        <li>Kisses see you later.</li>
    </ul>  
<p> There are many great topics on the Internet on Self-love to continue this journey. Learn to practice mindfulness and mindset. This will make you feel better to live a healthy life. Good Luck!</p>
