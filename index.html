        Greetings and a warm welcome to my sanctuary. My aspiration is for this site to ignite inspiration,fuel motivation,and provide
        the encouragement you need to embark on your journey as a novice DIY enthusiast. Before I started repairing things, I feared the worst.
        There is a famous saying. " feel the fear and do it anyway." And so, I followed through with that very advice, mentally reviewing the 
        sequential process of performing an oil change on my car, until I finally built up enough motivation to performing an actual oil change, and I did it.
        I have become a well-rounded DIY enthusiast ever since. If you generate the motivation, you too can accomplish anything through effort. 
        If your reason is too weak or inadequate, you will run out of steam to achieve it.
